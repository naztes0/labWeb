## Created and used
- [x] Custom Google Font (`DM Sans`) 
- [x] Adaptive layout: header/menu/footer stretch full width, content centered 
- [x] Fully responsive slider
- [x] Independent layout blocks (can be removed without breaking layout)
- [x] Semantic and stylized navigation menu
- [x] Logo added with width, height, and alt attributes
- [x] Feedback form appears with fade effect and includes validation styling

## ðŸ›  Technologies used

- HTML5 + semantic layout
- CSS3 + responsive design
- Google Fonts + @font-face
- JavaScript (basic interactivity)
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## Second-Level Pages

The project includes **two second-level pages** as required by the assignment.

When clicking on specific menu items (e.g., `Cart` or `Delivery`), the user is redirected to the corresponding second-level page. 
These pages maintain the same visual and structural design as the homepage and contain core layout blocks (`header`, `menu`, `footer`, etc.).



### ðŸ“‚ Pages
- `home.html` â€“ main catalog page with navigation and slider  
- `delivery.html` â€“ delivery info (second-level page)  
- `contact.html` â€“ contact form and info
